# HostelAllocation

## Introduction

This app project shows you how to connect your iOS application to an MySQL database hosted locally on your device.

**INTEGRATION OF SQL database with an iOS application**

We use a PHP service and send a POST request to the file to create a query and fetch the data from the database.

## Below are the various views of the application.
